Online portfolio from Mireia Falgueras 2023.

This is a grid-based, stratight to the point website which aims to highlight my visual approach on design, as well as my persona and experience. In it you'll see a collection of my selected works.

The website is structured as an only page presenting myself, my work and experience, aswell as a selection of projects and a contact section.
Aside, there's one detailed page for each project.

There's a desktop and phone verrsion of the site for better engagement and acessability.
Little animations happen on the website to bring some live to it, although it's very subtle since I dont want it to be a distraction from the content.

The website is developed using:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
